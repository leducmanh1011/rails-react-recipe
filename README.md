### Step 1 â€” Creating a New Rails Application

```ruby
rails new rails_react_recipe -d=mysql -T --webpack=react --skip-coffee
```

- The `-d` flag specifies the preferred database engine, which in this case is MySQL.
- The `-T` flag instructs Rails to skip the generation of test files, since you wonâ€™t be writing tests for the purposes of this tutorial. This command is also suggested if you want to use a Ruby testing tool different from the one Rails provides.
- The `--webpack` instructs Rails to preconfigure for JavaScript with the webpack bundler, in this case specifically for a React application.
- The `--skip-coffee` asks Rails not to set up CoffeeScript, which is not needed for this tutorial.

### Step 2 â€” Setting Up the Database

Need config file `config/database.yml`

```ruby
rails db:create


#Output
Created database 'rails_react_recipe_development'
Created database 'rails_react_recipe_test'
```

### Step 3 â€” Installing Frontend Dependencies

```ruby
yarn add react-router-dom bootstrap jquery popper.js
```

### Step 4 â€” Setting Up the Homepage


```ruby
rails g controller Homepage index
```

### Step 5 â€” Configuring React as Your Rails Frontend

Change name file `hello_react.jsx` to `Index.jsx`
```ruby
mv /app/javascript/packs/hello_react.jsx /app/javascript/packs/Index.jsx

```

Open file `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`, inside tag <head></head> includes

```ruby
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
<%= javascript_pack_tag 'Index' %>
```
