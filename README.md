### Step 1 â€” Creating a New Rails Application

```ruby
rails new rails_react_recipe -d=mysql -T --webpack=react --skip-coffee
```

- The `-d` flag specifies the preferred database engine, which in this case is MySQL.
- The `-T` flag instructs Rails to skip the generation of test files, since you wonâ€™t be writing tests for the purposes of this tutorial. This command is also suggested if you want to use a Ruby testing tool different from the one Rails provides.
- The `--webpack` instructs Rails to preconfigure for JavaScript with the webpack bundler, in this case specifically for a React application.
- The `--skip-coffee` asks Rails not to set up CoffeeScript, which is not needed for this tutorial.
